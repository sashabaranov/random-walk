This repo is for my coursework on Random Walk(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk).
Alternative name is Drunkard's Walk(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drunkard%27s_Walk).

This problem is connected with solving Schr√∂dinger equation with random potential.
It could describe:
a) Distribution of electric current in the crystal with defects.
b) Measurement of particle location and problem of wavefunction reduction.

Generalization of this problem on space with arbitrary dimensionality gives us some relatively simple parallels with results of String Theory. 


Task is to form probability distribution and try to describe Drunkard's wavefunction.


I'll use OpenMP because one adress-space is better in this task.
